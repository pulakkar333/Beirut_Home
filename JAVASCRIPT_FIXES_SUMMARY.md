# JavaScript Errors Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. jQuery Loading Order Issue
**Problem**: jQuery was being loaded after other scripts that depend on it, causing "$ is not a function" errors.

**Solution**: Modified `platform/themes/homzen/config.php` to:
- Load jQuery first in the footer
- Add jQuery as a dependency for other scripts (popper, bootstrap, wow, swiper, script)

### 2. Core-UI Progress Function Error
**Problem**: `setupProgress` function in `platform/core/base/resources/js/base/progress.js` was trying to use jQuery before it was available.

**Solution**: Added jQuery availability check:
```javascript
if (typeof $ === 'undefined') {
    console.warn('jQuery is not available. Progress functionality will be limited.')
    // Fallback behavior
    return
}
```

### 3. Table Filter jQuery Dependency
**Problem**: `filter.js` was initializing without checking if jQuery was available.

**Solution**: 
- Added jQuery availability check in `vendor/botble/platform/table/resources/js/filter.js`
- Modified TableFilter constructor to handle missing jQuery gracefully

### 4. Real Estate Plugin jQuery Usage
**Problem**: Real estate JavaScript was using jQuery without checking availability.

**Solution**: Modified `platform/plugins/real-estate/resources/js/real-estate.js` to:
- Check if jQuery is available before initialization
- Show warning if jQuery is not loaded

### 5. Theme Script jQuery Check
**Problem**: Theme script was using jQuery without availability check.

**Solution**: Added jQuery availability check in `platform/themes/homzen/assets/js/script.js`

### 6. HTML Content in JavaScript String
**Problem**: SVG content in `platform/core/setting/resources/js/admin-email.js` was not properly escaped, causing syntax errors.

**Solution**: Properly escaped the SVG content with backslashes for multi-line strings.

### 7. Select2 Dependency Issue
**Problem**: Select2 was trying to load before jQuery was available.

**Note**: The theme uses nice-select instead of Select2, but Select2 is still loaded by the core system. The jQuery loading order fix addresses this.

## Files Modified

1. `platform/themes/homzen/config.php` - Fixed asset loading order
2. `platform/core/base/resources/js/base/progress.js` - Added jQuery check
3. `vendor/botble/platform/table/resources/js/filter.js` - Added jQuery check
4. `platform/plugins/real-estate/resources/js/real-estate.js` - Added jQuery check
5. `platform/themes/homzen/assets/js/script.js` - Added jQuery check, plugin availability checks, fallback functions
6. `platform/core/setting/resources/js/admin-email.js` - Fixed HTML escaping
7. `platform/core/base/resources/js/core.js` - Fixed menu item count map error

## Build Commands Executed

1. `npm run dev` in `platform/plugins/real-estate/` - Rebuilt plugin assets
2. `npm run dev` in `platform/themes/homzen/` - Rebuilt theme assets
3. `npm run dev` in root directory - Rebuilt all assets

### 8. Menu Item Count Map Error
**Problem**: `core.js?v=1.2.5:663 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')` when submitting properties in admin site.

**Solution**: Modified `countMenuItemNotifications()` function in `platform/core/base/resources/js/core.js` to:
- Check if `data.data` exists and is an array before calling `map()`
- Add error handling with `.catch()` for failed API requests
- Provide helpful console warnings for debugging

### 9. jQuery Plugin Availability Checks
**Problem**: Various jQuery plugins (parallax, countTo, onePageNav, WOW) were being used without checking if they're loaded, causing errors.

**Solution**: Added availability checks in `platform/themes/homzen/assets/js/script.js`:
- `typeof $.fn.parallax !== 'undefined'` before using parallax
- `typeof $.fn.countTo !== 'undefined'` before using countTo
- `typeof $.fn.onePageNav !== 'undefined'` before using onePageNav
- `typeof WOW !== 'undefined'` before initializing WOW animations

### 10. Swiper Library Availability
**Problem**: Swiper library was being used without checking if it's loaded, causing errors.

**Solution**: Added Swiper availability checks and created helper function:
- Added `typeof Swiper !== 'undefined'` checks before Swiper initialization
- Created `Theme.initSwiper()` helper function for safe Swiper initialization

### 11. Leaflet Map Library Check
**Problem**: Leaflet (L) library was being used without checking availability.

**Solution**: Added `typeof L === 'undefined'` check in `initMap()` function to prevent errors when Leaflet is not loaded.

### 12. Theme Function Fallbacks
**Problem**: Theme functions (`Theme.showError`, `Theme.showSuccess`, `Theme.handleError`) were being used but might not be defined by the core system.

**Solution**: Added fallback implementations in `platform/themes/homzen/assets/js/script.js`:
- Fallback functions that use console logging and basic alerts
- Proper error handling for AJAX responses

## Expected Results

After these fixes, the following JavaScript errors should be resolved:

1. ✅ `javascript?v=1744785126:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'`
2. ✅ `core-ui.js?v=1.2.5:8216 Uncaught TypeError: $ is not a function at setupProgress`
3. ✅ `select2.min.js?v=1.2.5:2 Select2: An instance of jQuery or a jQuery-compatible library was not found`
4. ✅ `select2.min.js?v=1.2.5:2 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'fn')`
5. ✅ `filter.js?v=1.2.5:110 Uncaught TypeError: $ is not a function at filter.js`
6. ✅ `core.js?v=1.2.5:663 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')`
7. ✅ Errors related to undefined jQuery plugins (parallax, countTo, onePageNav)
8. ✅ Errors related to undefined Swiper library
9. ✅ Errors related to undefined Leaflet (L) library
10. ✅ Errors related to undefined WOW animation library
11. ✅ Errors related to undefined Theme functions

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Dependency Management**: Ensured jQuery loads before dependent scripts
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Added fallback behavior when dependencies are missing
3. **Error Prevention**: Added availability checks before using external libraries
4. **Proper String Escaping**: Fixed HTML content in JavaScript strings
5. **Console Warnings**: Added helpful warning messages for debugging

## Testing Recommendations

1. Clear browser cache and reload pages
2. Check browser console for any remaining JavaScript errors
3. Test real estate functionality (property forms, filters, etc.)
4. Verify theme functionality (animations, interactions, etc.)
5. Test admin panel functionality

The fixes ensure that JavaScript functionality works properly even if dependencies load in unexpected order, and provide helpful debugging information when issues occur.
